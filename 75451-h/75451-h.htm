<p class="hanging-indent1"><i>As the curtain rises a distant orchestra is heard playing
Leoncavallo’s “Mattinata.” The stage is almost
dark. The only light comes through two large
French windows at the back. Through them we see
the moonlit Mediterranean far below, the vague
outlines of the precipitous coast, twinkling lights
along quays and esplanades, and here and there
the faint glow from some lighted window. A lighthouse
blinks intermittently in the far distance.
Within the dark room three darker shadows loom
against the moonlit windows; the lighted ends of
three cigarettes prick the blackness. There is a
long pause. It is almost embarrassingly long. Just
before one wonders if anything is ever going to
happen a man’s voice breaks the silence.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE MAN’S VOICE.</span> When you stop talking, Sandor,
for sixty consecutive seconds, there’s something
wrong.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>One of the shadowy forms is seen to rise and
cross to the right wall. We hear the click of an
electric switch and instantly the stage is flooded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
with the warm glow of several electric sconces
and candelabra lamps. The light reveals a room
beautifully furnished in Italian Renaissance. At
the back one shallow step leads up to a raised
portion which runs the whole width of the room.
Behind it are the French windows, now closed,
with a balcony beyond them. To the right a
short flight of steps leads to a landing and a
door to a bedroom suite. To the left one step
leads up to a door to the hall and the remainder
of the castle. Occupying the right wall of the
lower portion of the room is a great fireplace
with a corbelled chimney. A long table stands
near it. At the left is a grand piano. Below the
piano in the left wall is a door to another bedroom.
All these doors are closed. Above the piano
toward the center is a small stand with a telephone
on it. There are comfortable chairs here
and there. The ceiling is beamed and carved.
The whole room reflects wealth and beauty.</i></p>

<p><i>The speaker, who has just lighted the room,
is a large and portly man of middle age. His
name is</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>. <i>He is in a dinner jacket, as
are his two companions</i>, <span class="smcap">Sandor Turai</span> <i>seated
in the center, and</i> <span class="smcap">Albert Adam</span> <i>near the piano</i>.
<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>is also middle aged, but younger-looking
and less portly than</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>. <i>A glance shows
him to be a man of consequence and dynamic
personality. He is wearing a monocle.</i> <span class="smcap">Albert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Adam</span> <i>is a dreamy, handsome boy just over the
threshold of manhood. The distant orchestra has
stopped playing.</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>reseats himself to the
right of</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span>, <i>and speaks again</i>.]</p>


<p>What’s on your mind, Sandor?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I was just thinking how extraordinarily difficult
it is to begin a play. The eternal problem of
how to introduce your principal characters.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> I suppose it must be hard.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> It is—devilish hard. Up goes the curtain,
there is a hush all over the theatre, people come
on the stage. Then what? It’s an eternity—sometimes
as much as a quarter of an hour before the
audience finds out who’s who and what they are all
up to.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I never saw such a fellow. Can’t you forget
the theatre for a single minute?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> No. That’s why I’m such a great dramatist.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> You can’t be happy for half an hour unless
you’re talking shop. Life isn’t all theatre.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, it is—if you write plays. You know what
Alphonse Daudet says in his Memoirs? When he
stood by his father’s death-bed, all he could think
of was what a wonderful scene it would make for
the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> It’s silly to let your job become an obsession.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, that’s the theatre. Either you master
it or it masters you. And of all the brain-racking
things in the world, beginning a play is the worst.
That’s where your technique comes in, my boy.
Take this scene here, for instance. We three—Curtain
goes up on three ordinary men in ordinary
dinner jackets. How is anybody to know even
that this room we’re sitting in is a room in a castle?
And how are they to know who we are? If this
were a play we would have to start jabbering
about a lot of thoroughly uninteresting things until
the audience gradually found out who we were.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Well? Why not?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Think how much simpler it would be if we
were to cut out all that stuff and just introduce
ourselves? [<i>He rises and addresses the audience.</i>]
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. We three
arrived to-night to spend a couple of weeks at this
castle. We’ve just left the dining-room where we
did ourselves remarkably well with some excellent
champagne. My name is Sandor Turai. I am a
playwright. I have been a playwright for thirty
years. I make a very good thing of it. I bow and
step back leaving the stage to you.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>steps back and</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>steps forward
and addresses the audience</i>.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Mansky—I,
too, am a playwright, and this gentleman’s
life-long collaborator. We are probably the best-known
firm in the business.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Come to Mansky and Turai for all comedies,
farces and operettas. Satisfaction guaranteed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I, too, make a very good thing out of it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Which brings us—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> —to the remaining member of the trio.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>They indicate</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>who rises and addresses
the audience in similar fashion but with more
diffidence and none of their assurance</i>.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> The last <i>and</i> least. I, ladies and gentlemen, am
Albert Adam. I am twenty-five years old and I
compose music.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Very good music, too.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> I have done the score for the latest operetta
by these two kind gentlemen. My first effort. They
discovered me. They got me invited to this castle.
Regardless of expense, they bought me a complete
wardrobe. Without them I am a complete nonentity.
I have no parents, no reputation, and no
money.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> But—you’re young.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> And gifted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> And in love with the prima donna.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Don’t bother to tell them that. An audience
takes it for granted that the young composer is
in love with the prima donna. It’s tradition.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Thank heaven.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Again addressing the audience.</i>] Isn’t that
the simplest way to begin a play?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Very crude. If that were all there was to
it, any fool could write plays.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> A great many do. But you see how absurdly
easy it is—All you have to do is—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> All right, all right, all right. For heaven’s
sake, stop talking shop. I’ve had enough. Save it
for to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Perhaps you’re right. Yes, it’s a treat to get
a couple of hours off for a change. Wonderful,
that trip in the car—Italy!... And here we
are, free at last from the stuffy world of behind
the scenes, out of the reach of thin-skinned actors
and thick-skinned managers. All the year I’ve
looked forward to these two weeks. A princely host
and a house full of smart people—just what men
like ourselves need to inspire us. And, mark this,
my friends, nothing to worry about—for our job
is done. [<i>He goes to the window, opens it, steps on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
to the balcony and speaks from there.</i>] The operetta
is finished and off our minds. And, moreover,
it is summer. The weather is perfect, the night
is gorgeous, the sea—is the sea, and the dinner
was good. [<i>He comes back into the room.</i>] Yes,
we must remember it. It’s been a great day. August
the 20th.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Friday.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What of it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I wish it wasn’t.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Don’t be such an old woman!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> No one ought to arrive anywhere on a
Friday.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Dreamily.</i>] What difference does it make—Friday,
Saturday, Sunday—Spring, Summer,
Autumn, Winter—life’s always wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] <i>My</i> unlucky day is Tuesday.
Among other things—[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>.] you
were born on a Tuesday.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Well, look at it for yourself. Here’s to-day’s
little bag of bad luck. San Martino—mid-day—violent
thunderstorm followed by blow-out. Set us
back an hour. Fiero—early afternoon—ran over
dog, surrounded by angry multitude, had to scatter
money to every one in sight to keep from getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
mobbed. More delay, and we reach here at
ten instead of eight. Friday. And when we arrive,
who is out? Our princely host. Who else? Everybody.
All gone off on a picnic. Friday. And the
beautiful, the one and only, the most vitally important
member of the whole house party—our
adorable prima donna—where is she? Also off on
a picnic. Is she expected home to-night? No. When
is she expected? No one knows. Friday.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Oh, she’ll be back.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Well, that won’t spoil Friday’s record, because
it’s Saturday now.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> And I’ve got to wait a whole night before I
see her. It’s cruel.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Just Friday.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, now listen to <i>me</i>. I’ll give you <i>my</i>
version of the day’s proceedings. Friday, San
Martino—mid-day—capital luncheon including
some really drinkable coffee. During the meal, a
few passing drops of rain. Result: perfect roads—no
dust. Fiero—early afternoon— Injured a
dog and for a while it looked as though the populace
were about to injure <i>us</i>. But our Friday good
luck held. The dog made a miraculous recovery
and when last seen was sitting up and taking
nourishment. And a few insignificant coins, judiciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
distributed, made the populace our friends
for life. To resume. We arrived here some hours
late, but—what a bit of luck <i>that</i> was. Everybody
away, nobody in the house to expect tired men to
make conversation. Furthermore we dine on a
picturesque terrace of a wonderful old Italian
castle and are given as fine a curried chicken as I
ever tasted.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I loathe curry.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> And in conclusion, let me tell you the crowning
piece of good fortune of this magical Friday.
[<i>He indicates the door to the bedroom at left.</i>]
The next room to this is Ilona’s.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> What!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, through that door is the room of the
beautiful, the one and only. And having a pull
with the butler, I managed to get this suite for
ourselves. There’s luck for you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> For him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> And for us. We profit indirectly. When a
composer is happy he writes song-hits. When a
prima donna is happy, she stops singing off the
key. And the librettists gather royalties from the
resulting triumph.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Sordid brute. You’ve no poetry in your soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> But I have a balance in my bank—much more
satisfactory. As for Ilona being away, that’s good
luck too. Think of the pleasant surprise she will
get. It is night. The little darling comes home
from her picnic. All unsuspecting, she goes to her
little room, sinks upon her little bed—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Why on earth must everything always be so
little?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Damned sentimentalism. I know the house
well. She has a <i>huge</i> room and an <i>enormous</i> bed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Immaterial. Quite immaterial. The point is
that she comes home, all unsuspecting. She doesn’t
know we’re here. [<span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>who has been sitting dreamily
at the piano begins playing softly</i>.] She doesn’t
know we’ve brought the finished operetta with us.
She doesn’t know I’m going to sing her the waltz
song from Act Two—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> God help her!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> ... the world-famous waltz—[<span class="smcap">Mansky</span>
<i>looks at him skeptically</i>] at least, it’s not world-famous
yet, but it’s bound to become so ... anyway,
the ravishing theme-waltz upon which this infant
genius has poured out all the treasure of his
love-bewitched soul....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>stops playing</i>.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Be quiet—never praise a composer. It unsettles
him. [<i>Rises. Looks at watch.</i>] Do you know
it’s after three—I have been thinking and I’ve got
an idea.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Beginner’s luck.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Let’s go to bed. You can do any singing
you want to-morrow. If they’re not home yet, it
means they’re staying out all night. I know the
ways of this house. We’ve been up since five and
I’m all in. Three hundred miles are chasing themselves
through my head. As for your infant genius
with the love-bewitched soul, he’s asleep already.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Who has been nodding over the piano, awakens
with a start.</i>] I’m not.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I’ve no objection to postponing the surprise-party.
Suppose we <i>wake</i> her with the waltz.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> If only she doesn’t find out before.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That’s all right. I particularly told my friend
the butler that nobody must know of our arrival
till to-morrow morning. The butler is a very important
man. He practically runs this house.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Rising.</i>] Then I’m going to take a bath.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I don’t follow your logic. What has the importance
of the butler to do with taking baths?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> I hate logic. [<i>Starts toward the door at right,
but stops to gaze out of the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Do you really intend to bathe at this hour?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> In the sea?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Stands by balcony door.</i>] No. In the tub.
[<i>The sound of a distant orchestra is heard playing
Toselli’s Serenade.</i>] When you’re tired and
sleepy and looking forward to something particularly
nice, it’s wonderful to lie in luke-warm water
with your eyes closed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Hear! Hear! [<i>Sits in large armchair.</i>]
Well—Do as you please, infant. When an artist
is working he must pamper himself. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>.]
You have to humor these composers. Did
you ever know his grandmother?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I had not that pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>comes down the steps and sits down
again</i>.] She brought him up when his parents died.
She was about <i>so</i> high. The littlest old woman I
ever saw in my life.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Tiny, wasn’t she?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> And the very opposite of this dreamy boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Always hustling, always on the go. It’s her fault
that our young friend here has always remained
such an unsophisticated babe. She not only mothered
him—she smothered him with her love. She
was like a little witch in a fairy-tale guarding
hidden treasure. I’ll never forget the day she
brought him to me, for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> My goodness, I was scared that day.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> So was I. This little half-portion of a woman
fixed me with blazing eyes and fairly hissed:
“This boy is a <i>genius</i>. You <i>must</i> hear his <i>work</i>.”
[<i>Pensively.</i>] His mother was a gentle, beautiful
woman.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> I hardly remember her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I can see her—very clearly—<i>still</i>.... [<i>He
rises and goes to <span class="smcap">Adam</span> whom he pats affectionately
on the shoulder</i>.] Ah, well, you’re going to escape
the struggles most young artists have before they
reach the top. No wasting of time and brain and
nerve-energy for you. You’ve got a very clever
man behind you, pushing you on.</p>

<p>[<i>Music stops.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Significantly.</i>] <i>Two</i> clever men.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Two? [<i>Laughs.</i>] Ah, yes, of course, two. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] So run away and have your bath and sleep
and dream and love and enjoy this beautiful world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and all that there is in it. Happiness will make
your music all the sweeter.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> You ought to be ashamed of yourself, encouraging
him to be a dreamer. He should be
learning by this time that life isn’t all music and
roses and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Why be in such a hurry to teach him that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I’m not in a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Then why must he be in a hurry to learn it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Who has run up the steps at right, pauses at
the door.</i>] This is my room, eh?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Whose else could it be? Have you forgotten
who is sleeping or about to be sleeping on the
other side of that wall? [<i>He indicates the left
wall.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> I should say I haven’t.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> It’s rather a good situation. Lovers—and
separated by a wall. Like Pyramus and Thisbe.
What is that speech of Pyramus’s? [<i>Speaking to
the left wall.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> And what about you two?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> We’re all right. Our room is on the other side
of yours.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Are you sharing a room?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> We have to. Real collaborators never separate
for a moment, or the most priceless ideas might be
lost forever. Besides, I talk in my sleep. I’m told
that’s when I say some of my best things. Mansky
is a light sleeper, and he wakes up and jots them
down. [<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>rises indignantly</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> I think I’m going to like this place. Well,
gentlemen, before I go, one last word. I am very
fond of both of you. I am finding life very beautiful.
And I am very happy. [<span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>goes out. Once
again the distant orchestra is heard. This time
playing the Brise Argentine.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Which startling utterance seems to call for
a glass of very old brandy. [<i>He crosses to the bell
rope on left wall and pulls it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Make it two.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> It’s nice to see the boy so happy. Now I’m
on the shady side of fifty, I find myself full of
parental affection and nobody to lavish it on.
[<i>Reflectively.</i>] Yes ... his mother was a gentle,
beautiful woman. [<i>He goes up to window, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
looks down the cliff.</i>] They’re still dancing down
there on the hotel terrace. With spot-lights on the
dancers. With that dark blue sky in the background
and the coloured lights on the water, that
wouldn’t make a bad setting for a first act finale.
[<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>who has just taken a cigarette from
his case, snaps it shut with irritation</i>.] Yes, I’m
coming to think the boy’s right and life is beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Sandor.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I didn’t like to tell you before, though it
really belongs to Friday, too.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Tell me what?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Sits on bench with the unconscious relish
of the confirmed pessimist.</i>] Something rather unpleasant.
A little piece of news. Rather unpleasant.
[<i>The music has stopped.</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>who
has been at the window, turns toward</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> You’re a queer chap. Just when a man’s feeling
happy for five minutes you have to come along
and take the joy out of life.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> It concerns you, too. It’s rather unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Going to</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>—<i>speaks ironically</i>.]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Well, come on, old friend. Ruin my evening. What
is it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I was looking in the visitors’ book downstairs,
and I saw a certain name. [<i>Puffs cigarette.</i>]
Yes, it’s rather unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Don’t sit there, making my flesh creep. What
name did you see in the visitors’ book?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Almady.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> The actor?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> He’s here?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> He is.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> H’m. This <i>is</i>, as you say, rather unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> You realize what this means?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> It means that you’re thoroughly happy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Not at all. I may be a pessimist, but unfortunately
I’m a tender-hearted pessimist. When
I am proved right, I do not enjoy the fact. The
fact is that Mr. Almady is here.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> But how? Why? He hasn’t been invited here
for ten years. I always understood he spent his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
summers with his wife and children at Lake
Balaton.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I suppose he fished for an invitation. He
probably had his reasons.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Does our young friend know anything about
that business?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> He hasn’t an inkling of the part Mr.
Almady has played in his fiancée’s life.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, hang it all, it wasn’t so much of a part.
What does it amount to? When she was starting
on the stage he gave her lessons in voice production.
And then—well, it was just the usual business—the
romantic leading actor and the little
pupil. The sort of thing that lasts a couple of
months at the outside. And, besides, it was all over
and done with long ago.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Apparently it is <i>not</i> over and done with.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Rot! Because by <i>pure</i> chance he happens to
be in the same house?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> It isn’t pure chance. It’s impure intention.
Use your intelligence, man. Ilona was Almady’s
discovery—he taught her all she knows.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That’s a thing of the past. Ilona’s intelligent.
She’s in love and she’s engaged to be married.
And you know how whole-heartedly, how passionately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
an actress can be engaged when she <i>is</i>
engaged to be married. I’m bound to say I’m not
remarkably enthusiastic about this match, but if
it makes the boy happy that’s the main thing. My
dear chap, you’re crazy. She wouldn’t be such
a fool ... with a worn-out elderly actor—a
father of a family—with four children. She’s got
too much sense.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I never said a word about that. I merely
said I had seen his name in the visitors’ book.
That means he is staying here. Is that pleasant?
No. It is unpleasant. That was all I said. I now
say something more. We <i>ought</i> to have <i>wired</i>
Ilona that we were coming to-night.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I admit it. You’re right again. So be happy.
Never surprise a woman. Always wire her in
plenty of time. On several occasions in a longish
life I have prepared a joyful surprise for a
woman, and every time I was the one surprised.
The telegraph was invented for no other purpose
than that women should not get surprises. [<i>There
is a knock at the door left.</i>] Come in. [<i>A footman
enters from the hall. He is an elderly man in

<p><span class="allsmcap">FOOTMAN.</span> What do <i>you</i> want, sir? You rang, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Oh, yes. Cognac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">FOOTMAN.</span> Any particular brand, sir?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>.] Do me a favor, old man, and
go up and keep Albert talking for a few minutes.
I want to have a few words with this fellow.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Don’t drink both the brandies. [<span class="smcap">Mansky</span>
<i>goes out through door at right</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What’s your name?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">FOOTMAN.</span> Mine, sir?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, yours.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">FOOTMAN.</span> Johann Dwornitschek, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Johann?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">FOOTMAN.</span> Dwornitschek.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Ah—Age?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Fifty-two, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Born?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I should have said, where were you born?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Podmokly. In Tcheko-Slovakia, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Nice place?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Ah—married?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir, thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Wife living?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Well, in a sense.... She ran away
with a soldier two years ago, sir—thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Don’t thank me—thank the soldier. You’re
new here, I think?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> When did you come?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Last summer, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Thank <i>you</i>, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> No, no. Thank <i>you</i>. You’ve answered my
questions most patiently.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Excuse me, sir, would it be taking a
liberty if I enquired why?...</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Why I have asked those questions? Not at all.
You’ll find that out later on. But don’t alarm
yourself. I’m not a detective. Now—Johann
Dwornitschek. Here are more questions. That
room next door there is Miss Ilona Szabo’s? [<i>He
indicates the door at left to bedroom.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Has she been gone long?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> I have not seen her come in, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Did you see her go out?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir. They left at six o’clock this
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> They? Who?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> The entire house-party, sir, including
the master. They were going to San Pietro,
I think, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Is that far?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> The yacht would take them there in
about an hour and a half. Twenty-six persons
in all, sir. Supper served on board. A nice cold
collation, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> When do you expect them back?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Well, sir—they took a considerable
quantity of liquor with them.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> The question I asked was “When do you expect
them back?”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> That is the question I’m answering,
sir. Hardly before to-morrow morning at the earliest.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I see. Who’s in the party?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> The core or center of it, if I may
use the expression, sir....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Certainly you may use the expression. It’s a
beautiful expression.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Thank you, sir. The core or center
of it is an American family, distant relatives of
the master. Every time a holiday comes around,
they insist on a picnic.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What holiday is to-day?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> I don’t know, sir. They have two
every week here. They always go off at night in
the big yacht. They’re quite wild about the young
lady. She sings for them on the yacht. With the
gypsy band.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Oh, they have gypsies, too?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir. Four pieces. From the Hotel.
But they’re not much good. No—A gypsy’s
not at his best, sir, on the water. Gypsies need
<i>solid</i> ground.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Solid ground—yes, of course. Well, passing
over the subject of gypsies for a moment, if you
don’t mind—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Oh, no, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, then lightly passing over the subject of
gypsies, do you know a Mr. Almady?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Oh yes, indeed, sir. I know Mr. Almady.
I know Mr. Almady very well. He has been
here three days.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Here in the castle?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir. In the old wing facing the
park.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That would be on this floor?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir, on this floor.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> And—he’s one of the yachting party, you
say?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir, along with the young lady.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What do you mean, <i>along</i> with the young
lady?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Well, sir, he escorted her to the
boat. They’re—you might say—sort of partners.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> How partners?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> I mean, sir—well, working together—like—like—as
it were, partners.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I see. You mean partners.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir. Partners. Mr. Almady
gives recitations on the boat.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> How do you know that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> They took me with them, sir, last
Tuesday.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Tuesday? It would be Tuesday.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir—Tuesday.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> All right—Thank you....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Thank <i>you</i>, sir. Will that be all,
sir?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, that will be all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Excuse me, sir, but you said that I
would find out later on....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Why I began by asking you all those personal
questions.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Exactly, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Quite simple. It’s a little matter of psychology.
When you want a man to speak the truth,
begin by making him tell you all about himself.
It gives him a feeling of responsibility and
makes him afraid to lie, later on. That’s from a
detective-play by Mansky and Turai. You can
take the tip as some slight return for your
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Don’t mention it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> And which shall I bring you, sir?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Which? What which?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Which brand of cognac?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Which brands have you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> All the best brands, sir. Hennessey,
Three Star Martel, Biscuit, Dubouche, Rivière—Gardrat....
[<i>A door is heard to slam somewhere
at left.</i>] Excuse me, sir. I rather think ... if you
would be good enough to remain quite quiet for
just one moment ... I rather fancy that’s the
young lady coming back now. [<i>They listen. From
the adjoining room at the left a soprano voice is
heard singing casually but clearly a well-known
aria from an operetta.</i>] Yes, sir. That’s the young
lady all right.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Going up toward the door at right.</i>] It is.
It’s she. Splendid. Then never mind the cognac.
<i>Champagne</i> is clearly indicated. My favorite
brand—Mumm’s Cordon Rouge. See that it’s iced
and hurry it along. Look sharp, man!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> You wish it here—sir?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Going out at right.</i>] Of course. Of course.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Very good, sir. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Dwornitschek</span>.
<i>He goes out through the door at left to
the hall. The singing grows louder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI’S VOICE.</span> [<i>In the room at right.</i>] Hey! Stop

voices of</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>are also heard</i>.] I
tell you she <i>is</i>. She’s in her room. Do be quick.
I’ve ordered champagne. Here, I’ll help you dress.
[<i>The door at the right is closed from the outside.
From inside the adjoining room on the left the
singing continues until interrupted by</i> <span class="smcap">Almady’s
Voice</span> <i>raised in protest</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> What do you mean by this singing?
I believe you’re doing it just to annoy me. [<i>She
trills a few notes.</i>] You’re trying to torture me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Well—it’s pretty cool to come walking
into my bedroom at this hour.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> I came with you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Now, listen. Everything’s over and
ended. I’ve put you out of my life forever. I’m
engaged to be married and I intend to be a good
little wife. You’ve no right to behave like this.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> No right? I, who made you? I, with
whom you have lived so many hours of madness—wonderful,
unforgettable—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Not unforgettable at all. Watch how
quickly <i>I’m</i> going to forget them. Do go away,
and leave me alone. Don’t touch me. [<i>A pause.</i>]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Stop. I won’t let you kiss me. Can’t you understand
my fiancé will be arriving any day now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> I’ll kill him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> You’ll do nothing of the kind. [<span class="smcap">Almady</span>
<i>sobs loudly</i>.] Oh, stop <i>crying</i>! The idea—a
grown-up man, the father of a family, with four
children.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> But I love you so, Ilona. And you
throw me over for another man. Don’t you love
me—still—just a little?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> You’re nothing but a great big baby.
Cheer up, do. That’s better. All right, then, you
<i>may</i> kiss me. [<i>A pause while they kiss.</i>] What are
you doing? Don’t take off your coat.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> I must. I want to say goodbye.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Well, you don’t need to say it in your
shirt-sleeves. [<i>Pause.</i>] <i>Now</i> run away and let me
get some sleep. I’m worn out.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> I’m only waiting till you’re in bed.
Is there anything to drink here?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> You’ll find it in the ante-room. Take
the whole bottle if you want to—but <i>go</i>. [<i>Pause.
Shouting.</i>] Look on the sideboard. And stay
where you are till I’ve got my nightie on. Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
come <i>in</i> and don’t <i>look</i>. [<i>There is a silence during

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Hush! She’s gone to bed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Do you think she’s asleep already?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I doubt it. Come on. Faces to the wall as close
as you can get. [<i>They group themselves in a row
as near the wall as the furniture will permit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Whispers.</i>] Ready? Now ... Ilona, Ilona,
Ilona ... take the time from me. [<i>Raises his
hand like a conductor; at the same moment</i> <span class="smcap">Almady’s</span>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> I worship you—I adore you. [<i>The
three are riveted where they stand, transfixed
with amazement.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Are you starting all over again?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> Yes, I am. All over again. I love
you as the church steeple loves the cloud that settles
above it and floats away with the first passing
breeze. I can’t go on living without you. Not a
week, not a day, not an hour. [<i>The three men turn
simultaneously.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> [<i>contemptuously.</i>] Just words.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> It’s the truth. I’m crazy about you.
And you—you’ve used me up and squeezed me
like a lemon, and now you want to throw me away.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> I don’t want to throw you away, silly.
Where’s the sense in raving like this? Oh, come
on, then. Come here and let me kiss your beautiful
classic brow.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> She said—did you hear what she said?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> That’s not a kiss—that’s a tip—Nothing
but a paltry tip.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Sinks into chair.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Don’t shout like that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> I will shout. I’m a squeezed lemon.
That’s what I am—[<i>Sobs.</i>] A lemon! The whole
world shall know that I’m a lemon.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Get off your knees. And, oh, please,
do stop crying. I can’t bear it. You know how
fond I am of you. [<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>clap their
hands to their heads</i>. <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>collapses on the piano
stool</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> Those nights of love—those flaming
wonderful nights! Have you forgotten them so
completely?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Looking up.</i>] That’s Almady.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> You can’t be sure.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>.] Don’t be an ass. Don’t
try to deceive a musician about a voice! There’s
no use talking—the thing’s a tragedy and we’ve
got to face it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Friday!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Stop! Control yourself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> You ask me to control myself—when
I look at <i>that</i>—at that perfect shape. The
rose flush of that skin.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Hands off!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> My God! How round it is! How
smooth, how velvety—and how fragrant. [<i>A
pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Don’t bite!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> I must—I am <i>so hungry</i>....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>and patting him on the shoulder</i>.]
I think you had better go, old man. Go and turn
in in our room.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] And I thought she was a Madonna.
Holding her in his arms—stroking—[<i>rising
in sudden fury and rushing to the door</i>.] God,
I could kill him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Restraining him.</i>] Steady, old man, steady.
[<span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>covers his ears with his hands</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> Ah, well! I see I am nothing to you
any more.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Oh, for goodness sake. I swear that
no man has ever meant so much to me as you.
From the top of your head to the soles of your feet
you are a <i>man</i>! Who should know that better
than I?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Come, come, my boy—let’s get out of this.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] Come on, old chap.
You’re going to sleep in our room. [<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>lead him to stairway</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Sleep! [<i>He goes out at right.</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>are on the landing</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Oh! Don’t look so pathetic....
Well, come here—kiss me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I was right— We ought to have sent a
telegram. [<i>He goes out at right.</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>comes
down to table, lights a cigarette and sits on edge
of table</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> I want you to remember that kiss
forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> It was your old kiss. Sweet and burning—like
hot punch. But do be a dear and go
away now. It was mad of you to come here. If my
fiancé ever hears of this I’ll kill myself. Oh, damn
my idiotic sentimentality for getting me into this
mess. You must leave here to-morrow on the first
train. He’ll be here any day now. [<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>shifts
uneasily</i>.] Every day I’ve been expecting a telegram.
[<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>groans</i>.] Get out, I tell you, get
out!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> If you insist, dear heart, so be it!
Your word is law. I am going to bed now. Farewell,
dear heart. But grant me one last kiss.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>To himself.</i>] Damn all fools who don’t know
when they’ve had enough.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Go <i>now</i>—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY’S VOICE.</span> So be it. Good-night, dear heart.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Good-night, you baby. [<i>Silence. A
door is heard closing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>To himself.</i>] <i>At last!</i> Good-night, dear
heart! [<i>After a moment he sits down in armchair.
Pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>re-enters</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>With a gesture of inquiry toward</i> <span class="smcap">Ilona’s</span>
<i>room</i>.] This silence—what does it mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> This silence is a highly moral silence. The
baritone hero has departed. And the fair heroine
has deposited herself in bed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> After depositing <i>us</i> in the worst mess in my
whole experience. Wasn’t it awful?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Awful!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Smooth, round, fragrant! And he wanted
to bi— oh, my God! [<i>He sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Ten minutes ago we were three happy men.
That poor boy! How is he?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I got him to bed. Poor little Pyramus. A
jolly wall, that, isn’t it? Church Steeple! Lemon!
The damned fool.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I can’t look him in the face. That little old
grandmother of his—she’d let me have it with
her broomstick if she were here.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> It’s certainly the most appalling mess. You
got it through your pull with the butler! Marvelous
luck! Pyramus and Thisbe! “Oh sweet
wall!” Well, I hope you’re satisfied!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Oh, go to the devil.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I don’t want to be unkind, but whichever
way you look at it you’re to blame for this catastrophe.
Why the deuce was it necessary to put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
boy next door to his lady-love? Friendship <i>is</i>
friendship, but there are limits.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I was merely trying to be sympathetic and
helpful. I meant well.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Never mean “well.” It’s fatal. See what’s
happened as a result. Bride gone—love gone—waltz
gone—operetta gone. All a total loss. On
the other hand, the dog didn’t die and the coffee
<i>was good</i>. Well, Friday has certainly made a nice
clean, efficient job of it <i>this</i> time!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I’m only thinking about that boy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> And I’m also thinking about our operetta.
The lady kissed the lemon’s classic brow. After
this, can you see her playing the part?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Do stop jabbering about that side of it. I’m
only interested in the boy. Did he say anything?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Plenty. I wish I hadn’t heard it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What <i>did</i> he say?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> One of his remarks was “I’ll tear up the
score and kill Ilona.” The round and fragrant
one. And the problem that presents itself to me is
this: if he tears up his music and kills the prima
donna, what sort of a <i>first night</i> shall we have?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Thinks a moment, then with emphasis.</i>]
We’ll have a first night. I promise you that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> What, after all this?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, after all <i>this</i>. Don’t worry, we’ll have
a first night all right.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> With that music?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> With that music and that composer and that
prima donna. And I’ll tell you some other things.
We’ll have a hit, a wedding, and a happy ending.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Well, of all the optimists! It’s just a suggestion,
but wouldn’t it be a good idea if you were
to mention just what you propose to <i>do</i>. This is
where Sandor Turai, famous for his happy endings,
had better try to surpass himself. [<i>Turns
toward stairs.</i>] Get busy, my play-writing genius,
and let’s see how good you are.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> One can but do one’s best. [<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>goes out
at right. A clock in the hall is heard to strike four.</i>
<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>takes a blank sheet of music from the
piano. He paces up and down in deep thought,
occasionally glancing toward</i> <span class="smcap">Ilona’s</span> <i>room. He
jots down a few words.</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>re-enters</i>.] Well,
how is he?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. That’s
bad. He didn’t even answer my question.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What did you ask him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I said: [<i>Plaintively.</i>] “Feeling better
now?”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What did you expect him to answer to a damn
fool question like that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Well, have <i>you</i> solved the problem?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> If I have I’m not going to tell you. You’ve
ruined enough good ideas of mine already with
your collaboration. This time I mean to work
alone. Without a partner. [<i>Goes to table. Sits on
bench.</i>] All I ask of you is a little information.
There are a few <i>facts</i> I require.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Huffily.</i>] That’s all I’m good for, is it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That’s all. Where are Almady’s wife and
family now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> At Lake Balaton, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Lake Balaton. Address?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Verona Cottage.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Putting it down.</i>] Verona Cottage. What’s
Ilona’s mother’s name?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Adele,—Alma, something.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, it begins with an A?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Yes, I know that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Thank God! Mrs. A. Szabo. What’s her address?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> 70 Elizabeth Avenue, Fured.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Would she be there now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Petulantly.</i>] Oh God! How should I
know? But, listen—[<i>Points to</i> <span class="smcap">Ilona’s</span> <i>room</i>.]
My own humble suggestion would be to wake her
up now and have a little chat.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What about?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Starting across.</i>] I’ll rout her out. [<i>Goes
left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Excitedly.</i>] For heaven’s sake, no! The only
thing a woman can do is deny everything. What
could she deny? Could she unsay those words of
hers? Gloss over that mad sensual outburst? Explain
her half-hearted resistance? Of course, she
might point out that it was nice of her to forbid
the man to bite. No, I can’t quite see where denials
come in.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Women have lots of other tricks. Falling
on their knees—fainting—bursting into tears—laughing
hysterically—or just going <i>rigid</i> all
over.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That might be good enough for you or me.
When you’re a middle-aged dramatist, you welcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
a chance to do the noble, forgiving business.
It’s good theatre. But that boy in there is twenty-five
and he isn’t a dramatist. So think again.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Collapsing hopelessly in armchair.</i>] Then
there’s no solution to the problem.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> There’s a solution to everything—one has
only to find it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> By Jove! Rather a good line, that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Not bad. Jot it down. [<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>does so, on
his cuff</i>.] And now the most important thing is—be
very tactful and understanding with the boy.
Sit by his bed till he falls asleep.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> He won’t sleep to-night.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Give him something to make him ... he
must have sleep. To-morrow’s going to be a big
day. One false move and he will be the center of
a record scandal. It would break his heart. And on
his peace of mind depends....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Our success. Capacity business. A year’s
run.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Beastly words.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> And yet only yesterday—how beautiful
they sounded!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Go away. I’ll take on this job. [<i>Rises.</i>] Leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
everything to me, and base your confidence on
past experience. Which shows the moment <i>you</i>
stop trying to help me, I can solve anything.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Bows stiffly and turns toward stairs.</i>]
Thank you, my dear fellow.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Good-night.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Good-night. See you to-morrow. Till then,
don’t leave him for an instant. That’s official. I’ve
enjoyed our little talk so much. Good-night.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Good-night. [<i>Goes out at right.</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span>
<i>goes to table, sits and jots down some more notes.
There is a knock at door left to hall.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Come in. [<span class="smcap">Dwornitschek</span> <i>enters with cooler
and champagne, four glasses on a tray</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> The champagne, sir. Mumm’s Cordon
Rouge—just as you ordered.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Motioning it away.</i>] ’M yes. But that was a
long time ago. A very long time ago. Since then
the world has changed quite a good deal. However,
the motto of the Turais is “Never refuse
champagne,” so put it down. [<span class="smcap">Dwornitschek</span>
<i>places tray on the table and the cooler on the
floor</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Will four glasses be sufficient, sir?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Three more than sufficient. [<span class="smcap">Dwornitschek</span>
<i>leaves one glass on the tray before</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span>, <i>he
places the other three on the table. There is a
pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>stares at him</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Something in the expression of your
eye, sir, tells me that you are trying to remember
my name.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Quite right. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Dwornitschek, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Still Dwornitschek? Well, well! All right,
Dwornitschek, you can go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> At what hour would you desire
breakfast, sir?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What time is it now?—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Quarter past four, sir.—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Then let us say at seven—or perhaps six.</p>

milk, honey, jam, rolls and tea.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Shouts with revulsion.</i>] No! [<i>Quietly.</i>] No—with

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> [<i>Starts to go.</i>] Very good, sir. At
six precisely.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Tell me, Dwornitschek, when do you sleep?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> In the winter, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What are you waiting for?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> I was wondering if there were any
more questions you desired to ask me, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> No, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Thank <i>you</i>, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> No, no, thank <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span>.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> I love being asked questions, sir. It
shows that gentlemen take an interest.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> You mean in Dwornitschek, the man? As opposed
to Dwornitschek, the servant?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Yes, sir. You are sure you have
nothing more to ask, sir? It would be a treat for
me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Nothing more, thanks. My stock of knowledge
for to-day is complete. I wish it weren’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Then I will bid you good-night, sir.
[<i>Starts to go.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Good-night.... One moment! There is one
other thing. Where is the writing paper? And I’d
like some telegraph blanks too. And ink, and also
a pen.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> The writing materials are in the library,
sir, but I can bring them to you here.
[<i>Starts to go.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Don’t bother. I’ll do my writing in the library.
It’s a good idea. No chance of being interrupted.
[<i>Rises and goes up the first step.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> I’ll go and turn on the lights, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> One moment. [<i>Points to champagne.</i>] That—can
come too.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Very good, sir. [<i>Takes cooler and
one glass.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Pausing.</i>] After you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK</span>. Oh no, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> My dear Dwornitschek, I insist. You’re sure
that really <i>is</i> your name?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Oh yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I only wondered. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Thank you—is that a medical opinion,

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Anything you have.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA’S VOICE.</span> Do what? I can’t hear. There must

Sandor—what is it? I feel something terrible has

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Sit down.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Because if you don’t sit down now, you’ll sit
down later on when you hear what I’ve got to say—and
you’ll sit down <i>hard</i>. Better do it gracefully

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> You will. My dear little Ilona, in spite of the
fact that you are engaged to my young friend
Adam, you are still carrying on an affair with
Mr. Almady.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>With indignation.</i>] It’s an outrageous lie.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Good! I thought you were going to say it
was none of my business.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> I couldn’t say that, because you’re Albert’s
guardian, guide, philosopher and friend and God
knows what else. And you’re a friend of <i>mine</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
write plays for me. So I simply say that it’s a
lie.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I’m glad you do, because it’s an observation
which I can answer. I’ve been in this room since
last night and the walls in this new wing are as
thin as paper.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Looks at walls. As the truth dawns upon her

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Lemon. [<span class="smcap">Ilona</span> <i>hides her face</i>.] Lemon....
Church steeple. Well, dear Ilona. Suppose we talk
this over? Something’s got to be done—and done
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> If you heard, you heard what <i>I</i> said too.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Every word.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Then you know that I told him to get out—and
he’s <i>getting</i> out to-day. At twelve o’clock. So,
if you don’t say anything—and of course you
won’t....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Not quite so fast, please. If the thing were as
simple as that, you would never have known from
me that I had overheard you. I regret to say
matters are much more unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Sinking back in chair.</i>] My God! You don’t

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I see you’ve guessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Did—did—I can’t say it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I will say it for you. Yes, the boy <i>did</i> hear it,

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span>.] God!... He’s <i>here</i>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> He is here.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Where?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Sh! He’s up in Mansky’s room—asleep. And
last night he was in this room—awake.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Rises, goes toward her room.</i>] I’ll take
veronal, all there is in my bottle.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That’s not enough.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Turns.</i>] Ten ounces.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I was not referring to the veronal. I mean
suicide is no solution.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> There isn’t any solution that I could survive.
[<i>Dramatically.</i>] There are only two things I can
possibly do—kill myself or deny the whole story.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Deny the whole story? Do you suppose if it
were just a question of telling lies, I would have
troubled you? I’d have told them myself long ago.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Then we come back to the veronal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Exactly. We come back to the veronal—and

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Well, what <i>do</i> you suggest?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I have my plan. And all I ask of you is not
to hinder it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Almost crying.</i>] You know I worship Albert.
If anybody knows that, you do. I’ve been a different
woman since I met him. He looks on me as
a saint. [<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>gives her a quick ironic glance</i>.]
And he’s right. I <i>have</i> turned into a saint since I
began to love him. It was the only thing I wanted
to do in life—to keep straight for his sake. I was
so happy. [<i>She sinks into armchair crying.</i>] I love
him so.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> And yet you can’t be true to him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Indignantly.</i>] You’ve no right to say that.
It was nothing but my damned sentimentality.
You know very well that affair with that beast
Almady didn’t last a couple of months. First he
gave me breathing lessons and taught me how to
throw my voice—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>With a significant glance.</i>] Yes, he taught
you that, all right.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> I’m just a victim of my kind heart. I thought
I was rid of him, but he got himself invited here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
And he’s always bursting into tears. A woman
hates to see a man cry. He stuck to me like a leech.
[<i>Rises and stalks about hysterically.</i>] But why
on earth would I want to start in with him again?
I give you my word, Sandor, that last night was
simply—like the last dying vibrations of a high
note.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> You’d have done better to stop vibrating a
little earlier. Still, there it is. What we’ve got to
do now is—get you out of the mess.</p>

Sandor darling! Do you really think you <i>can</i>?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, I can. But don’t think I’m doing it for
your sake, my dear; not for the sake of your
beautiful eyes. You deserve to be drawn and
quartered. I’m doing it for that poor decent boy
who still retains a few ideals in this unpleasant
world. Yes, my dear Ilona, I think I must ask you
to be a little ashamed of yourself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] Don’t worry. [<i>Rises.</i>] I am.
What can I do?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Goes to telephone.</i>] I am just going to tell
you. And you won’t enjoy it. Still, good medicine’s
rarely pleasant. [<i>Picks up receiver.</i>] Hello. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Ilona</span>.] What’s the number of Almady’s room?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Apprehensively.</i>] What do you want with
him?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Into the telephone.</i>] Give me Mr. Almady’s
room, please. [<i>Pause.</i>] Never mind about all that,
my good man. I don’t care what instructions he
left—call him. And go on ringing till he answers.
It’s a matter of life and death.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> What are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>In telephone.</i>] Mr. Almady? Yes, yes, I
know you gave instructions.... Will you please
be quiet for a moment?... This is Sandor Turai
speaking. Here in the new wing.... Last
night, by car.... Good morning—you were
awake already! Capital! Would you mind coming
here at once. Room number four.... Yes, I
mean <span class="allsmcap">NOW</span>, right away.... Yes, matter of life
and death was what I said, but I made a slight error.
I should have said a matter of death—Yes,
yes, this very minute—right. [<i>He hangs up the

to?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> If Almady is coming here?...</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> You will kindly stay just where you were.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Looking toward</i> <span class="smcap">Albert’s</span> <i>bedroom at right,

I was everything that was fine and pure. He called
me his Madonna.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> You should have thought of that a long time
ago.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Tell me—what did Albert say?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I wouldn’t ask that if I were you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> God! What was the plan you said you had?...
Can’t you speak?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Patience.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> It’s too cruel.... Just because I hate hurting
people’s feelings.... [<i>She breaks off as a

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Indignantly.</i>] It’s an outrageous lie.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> In that room next door—last night—something

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Ashamed.</i>] Yes, yes, <i>please</i>. We know what

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That is just what you don’t know. You are

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> In the middle of the night.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> How do you mean—the rehearsal of a play?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Your very loud remarks, so loud that they

a play. Now, do you understand?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Pointing.</i>] Here you are. Here’s the play.
This is it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Who wrote it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I did. Don’t stare at me, my dear child, with
those starry eyes of blue. [<i>Sits on bench.</i>] Rather
ask when I wrote it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> When could you have written it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> This morning—between four and six. After
all, one is either a playwright or one isn’t. Half of
it I heard through the wall; the other half I wrote
to fit. In this life, everyone has to fight with his
own weapons. My weapon is the pen! And, on this
occasion I hope it will prove considerably mightier
than the sword. I am feeling this morning like an
acrobat, who for once has the chance to use his skill
to save a life. I don’t suppose any play has ever
yet been written with such purely altruistic
motives. Well, there you are. There’s the play.
Read it—learn it and play it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Now what is it?</p>

rehearsing at three in the morning?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That’s what I ask myself, but I answer myself—quite
simple. You had to play the thing to-night.
You’d lost a lot of time on a picnic. Every
moment was precious. You were so conscientious
that when you came home you insisted on rehearsing
even though it was three o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> French.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Into the telephone.</i>] French. [<i>As before.</i>]
Who wrote it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Geraldy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Apprehensive.</i>] What’s nice?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Hand over receiver.</i>] He says he knows
every line that Geraldy ever wrote.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Then it’s by Sardou.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Into the telephone.</i>] No, I’m sorry. I’ve just
been looking at the script again. It’s not by
Geraldy; it’s by Sardou.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> The Great Sardou.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Into the telephone.</i>] The Great Sardou!...
Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> How is he up on Sardou?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Covering receiver.</i>] He says the only thing
of Sardou’s he knows is Hedda Gabbler.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Delighted.</i>] That’s the man for us!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Into the telephone.</i>] That’s the man for us.</p>

You’ve been so sweet.... Oh, of course—as if
we’d dream of having anybody but you as a

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Merely to ensure that nobody will know who
wrote it. That’s the beauty of French literature—there’s
such a lot of it. Besides, one has one’s conscience.
I’ve stolen so much from the French in
my time that it’s only fair I should give <i>them</i>
something for a change. And now that everything
seems to be working out all right, let me say with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
all the emphasis at my disposal—get out. Go and
study! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Almady</span>.] And—so that no one will

out the script.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> From beginning to end.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Who has been looking through the script.</i>]
Oh, but this isn’t right.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What isn’t?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> This line. You make me say “Your kiss is revolting
to me.” What I really said was....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> “That was your old kiss. Sweet and burning
like hot punch.” I know. My memory is excellent.
But fortunately we got the boy out of the room
before you got that far.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> And may I be permitted to inquire <i>why</i> my
kiss should be described as revolting?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> The line occurs in the second part of the
play, where I was relying on my native inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> You call my kiss revolting? I wish to know
why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That is how I <i>see</i> it. I am the author of this

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, stupid of me, I admit. You see, I always

minute I did think that you really were acting.
Later on, I realized my mistake.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> You thought we were acting. Why?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Because it all sounded so artificial. No ring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of conviction. I refer particularly to the more
erotic passages.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> I don’t wonder. Considering I don’t care one
little bit for the man....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> You heard.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> You don’t love me?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Furious.</i>] So you were lying.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Just to get rid of me?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>With loathing, vehemently.</i>] Yes. I hate the

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] Serpent!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> I’d like to murder you!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Bursts into ludicrous sobs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> My God!—this is the limit!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> If you want to cry all over anyone, cry all
over me. I like it. It’s like a tonic to me.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> What made you realize that we were not
acting?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> The disgusting, sloppy way you began carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
on. No author living would dare put slush like
that in the mouth of an actor who was supposed to
be making love.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Sloppy?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Beyond words.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, the passage is underlined in red ink.
Three pages—here—from page sixteen. It goes on
“Come here and let me kiss that beautiful classic
brow”—and then—this is the worst bit, here—this
mad outburst of sensuality—[<i>Reads

it!...”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Yes, but I....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I know, I know. [<i>Reads.</i>] “Hands off!” you
said. But he couldn’t have obeyed you for he goes
on “My God! How round it is! How smooth! How
velvety!” And then I’m afraid he must have got
very close indeed for he adds, “And how fragrant.”
That’s right, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Quite right. It <i>was</i> fragrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> No, my dear, you did <i>not</i>. There was a complete
silence until you exclaimed, “You mustn’t
bite....” [<i>Both turn away.</i>] Yes, I should think
you <i>would</i> be ashamed of yourselves. [<i>He gives</i>
<span class="smcap">Ilona</span> <i>the script</i>.] All right, then; copy it out and
learn it. If you ever studied parts in your lives,
study these. We’ll have the dress rehearsal at

you a run through. And after dinner, first performance.

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Not a word. Just stared at the ceiling.

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Ceilings aren’t so bad. Walls are much worse.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> What I can’t understand is why a magnificent

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span>.] What about that solution
you were hinting at last night?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> There were several possibilities. I considered
them all thoroughly in the night watches—while
you lay snoring in your bed. Oh yes, I heard you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
while I was changing my clothes. [<i>Points to the
table.</i>] Telegrams, letters, all ready. Finally I hit
on the best and simplest plan.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Which is?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I’m going to do everything possible to make
him break with her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Because that’s the surest way of bringing
them together. If he casts her off forever—in two
weeks he’ll be rushing after her and falling at her
feet. The lady—after a little coaxing—will allow
herself to melt. He will coax a little more. She will
melt a little more. Finally she will melt altogether—and
the curtain will fall on the lovers’ slow embrace.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>With cumulative contempt.</i>] You thought
of that in the night, did you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I did.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> All by yourself?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> All by myself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Well!!! I’ve noticed all this past year that
you’ve been slipping. I realise now, that you’ve
completely lost your grip. Our last show died the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
death simply because you would write psychology
into it. And now you’ve become simply drivelling.
It’s a great shock to me. Do you know what’s happening?
Little by little you’re beginning to think—and
that spells ruin for both of us. Haven’t you
grasped yet what a frightful knock-down blow
last night’s affair was to that boy?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Sh! Sh! [<i>Listens, pointing to door right.</i>]

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Quite reasonable. And then?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Then I’ll tear up the music I wrote for her—tear
it into little bits and burn it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Right. And after that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Don’t be so casual. You know I have nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>, <i>who has once more started on

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Jumping up.</i>] No. It’s no good. Absolutely
can’t swallow. I’m a very sick man.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> You see? I’m to blame for that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Now listen to me, my boy. Sit down. [<span class="smcap">Adam</span>
<i>sits</i>.] What has happened, has happened. It’s
over, done with, a thing of the past. And I’m
going to say something to you now which no
young person will ever believe. You’re twenty-five
and you’re gifted. The world’s at your feet. And
that world, let me remind you, contains a great
many million women.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> What good are they to me? I only wanted this
one. [<i>Rises.</i>] Can’t we get away now—at once. I
won’t see her!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Oh yes, you will. No scandals, if you please.
You arrived here late at night; everybody knows
she is your fiancée, you can’t run away this morning.
Now, I’m not going to urge—in fact, I—er—positively
forbid you to become reconciled to her,—but
you must do the sensible thing. In the
course of the morning we will go to her and pay
our respects, and stay on here another day or two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
and we will not breathe a word of what happened
last night. You will behave towards her quite
nicely and naturally. I know it will hurt. It’s a bitter
pill to swallow. But to-day you are a man.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Yes. You’re right.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Up with the head and out with the chin and
damn everybody! That’s the stuff. The day after
to-morrow, when we leave, you shall write her a
letter, and let yourself go as much as you like.
And, no matter how it may hurt, you have finished
with that woman forever.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>With an effort.</i>] Very well. And if—it
should hurt <i>too</i> much, don’t be afraid that I’ll go
back to her. I’ll always have pluck enough to put
a bullet through my head.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> There! See where you have got us to with

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Last night, when we came into this room, I
was saying how hard it was to begin a play. I’m

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Oh, come and end your breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> No, I mean it. It’s worrying me. Take this
situation of ours, for instance—just as we did
yesterday—We have had a curious experience.
We arrived perfectly happy and immediately got
a terrible shock—a ghastly disillusionment. We’ve
managed to survive it, and we’ve got ourselves in
hand again. But, suppose these things had happened
not in real life but on the stage—suppose
this were not a real room but a painted set—suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
we three were characters in a play who had
just passed through the experiences we have
passed through—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, how would you end the act?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Impatiently.</i>] My dear fellow! It’s ended
already.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> In a way, yes. But don’t forget that, at the
last moment, before the curtain actually falls, you
need something more—a new note of suspense—a
punch—both, if you can manage it. In fact,
just what is implied in that word “Curtain.” Curtain—Curtain.
The act must end and yet it must
not quite end. The audience’s interest must be
snapped up—given a jolt. So, my distinguished
collaborator, how about it? You’ve often told me
how good you are—try your hand at ending the
second act of this dismal adventure of ours.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> My dear chap, simplicity itself. Come here.
Sit down. [<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>sits at table</i>.] Now then. I’m
all for the quiet curtain. One of those charming
delicate things the French do so well. <i>You</i> know—sophisticated—lightly
sentimental—the smile
behind the tear. The three friends sit down to
breakfast. Audiences always like to see actors
eating. The storm has passed. The skies are still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
a little dark, but there is sunshine in the heart and
all that sort of thing. Let this sink in for a bit—everything
very cozy and pleasant. Business of
eating—we each have a glass of wine. [<i>They all
take up their glasses.</i>] For a moment—silence—their
thoughts are busy with what has passed.
[<i>Pause.</i>] Capital. And then—[<i>He raises his
glass.</i>]—you want a couple of smart lines, spoken
with something of a flourish. [<i>Thinks.</i>] Oh, well—[<i>Then
as if he had thought of what he wanted to
say—to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] My young friend, to-day you have
become a man—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Pointing to where he was sitting at the
time.</i>] <i>I</i> said that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> For—always remember—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes, that shows ’em it’s coming.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Not heeding him.</i>] Always remember that
in affairs of the heart it is not the first victory
that makes us men, but the first defeat. [<i>Lifts his
glass.</i>] To Woman’s Treachery, which has made
our child a man! [<i>Raises his hand toward the
curtain.</i>] Curtain. [<i>Curtain starts to come down.
They put their glasses down on the table, simultaneously,
untasted.</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>smiles complacently</i>.]
How’s that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Rotten! [<i>Curtain slowly goes up again.</i>]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
[<i>Gets up.</i>] Tame. Feeble. Nothing in the nature

graceful. Charming even—but it lacks suspense.
[<i>Pause.</i>] [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] How would <i>you</i> do it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> I? Feeling as I do now?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Give us your idea.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>With tremendous intensity.</i>] Very well, I’ll
give you my idea. We start from where Mansky
gave that toast.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> To Woman’s—?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Rises.</i>] Treachery. That’s it. I’d say—“No.
I won’t drink any toast.” [<i>Throws glass against
the wall smashing it to bits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Approvingly.</i>] Effective.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Rapidly losing control of himself and becoming
hysterical.</i>] That woman was not just an
incident in my life. She was my first great passion.
I promised to act as if nothing had happened. I
meant to keep that promise. But when I remember
that I gave her my life and that she whispers
words of love to another man—and—and kisses
another man, that’s such unbearable, burning
torture, that the only right solution— [<i>Grabs

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Leaping forward.</i>] Hey! Stop that!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> [<i>Struggling with him.</i>] No! No!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Rushing forward.</i>] My God! You weren’t

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Putting the knife away.</i>] Very bad. [<i>Curtain

all right for the end of a play, but absolutely no
good for a second act. Besides, the scene was too
crude. I don’t say the gallery might not like it,
but think what the critics would say. They despise
melodrama. Suspense is what you want—suspense

Ilona— [<span class="smcap">Ilona</span> <i>rises, gasping</i>.] I have a

Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Is that an elegant table?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> Well, really—no. But what can one expect in
a garden? Oh—if only the scene had been an interior—there’s
some perfectly lovely furniture in
the Count’s room—genuine Louis the Fifteenth. A
very elegant period, Louis the Fifteenth.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> I don’t care a damn. They’re all the same
to me. Louis the Fifteenth or Louis the Fourteenth
or Louis the Seventeenth.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> But there isn’t a Louis the <i>Seventeenth</i>, and
I’ve often wondered why. Why, I’ve wondered,
should there be a Louis the <i>Sixteenth</i> and a Louis
the <i>Eighteenth</i>, but not a Louis the <i>Seventeenth</i>?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Exasperated.</i>] Oh, God. Ask a furniture
dealer.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> I did. I’m <i>always</i> asking furniture dealers.
But they only know as far as Louis the <i>Sixteenth</i>.
That’s where the Louis stop for furniture dealers.
Whenever I say Louis the <i>Seventeenth</i> they say
you mean the <i>Sixteenth</i>, and I say no, I don’t
mean Louis the <i>Sixteenth</i>, I mean Louis the <i>Seventeenth</i>
and.... [<i>Breaks off and mops his

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Oh, you’ve noticed that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> What have <i>you</i> got to be nervous about?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> I’m always like this on these big nights. You

I’m expected always to applaud at the right moment.
I assure you I have often gone to bed after
one of these entertainments with my hands so tender
I could scarcely hold my toothbrush. [<span class="smcap">Almady</span>

it, sir, but you don’t seem quite your merry

brain had been addled from studying an infernal
part all day.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> But I thought you said you had spent the day
writing?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Yes, I—I always memorize a part by writing
it out.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> What energy! What enthusiasm! Have you

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Oh, I don’t mind. But you’ll be thoroughly

it after dinner. I should have thought once would

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Well, as a matter of fact, Mr. Turai asked me

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Glibly.</i>] Traitress, you have deceived me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
I have long had my suspicions. I have now in my
possession the proofs. No doubt you supposed me
a credulous imbecile whom it was simple to hoodwink.
You thought that any story would do for
me? You imagined that I was fool enough to
swallow anything. Let me tell you, madame, that
you are mistaken. For a long time I have suspected
that there was something behind all these rides of
yours with our neighbor the Marquis Jean François
Gilette de la Tour d’Argent. Day after day,
for hours at a time, you have made a practice of
riding with him on the road from Duvernois Sur
Saône to Saint Sulpice de la Grande Parmentière—and
slowly at that!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> It’s a lie. Who told you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Silence, woman! The proofs are in my
pocket. Mon Dieu, is there no gratitude in this
world? When I married you, who were you? A
nobody. Your father, Brigadier-General Pierre
Jean Bourmond de la Seconde-Chaumière-Rambouillet,
fell in battle at Grande-Lagruyère Sur
Marne, and you eked out a scanty living as a
seamstress at your mother’s home in the village
of Saint Genevieve, in the Department of Seine
et Oise. So, madame! And then what happened?
<i>I</i> came. I gave you name, rank, and wealth
such as you had never dreamed of. You became
Madame La Countess du Veyrier de la Grande<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Contumace Saint Emilion. I bestowed upon you
not only my estates in Pardubien-Grand-Amanoir,
but also my two castles in Challenges-Debicourt
de la Romanée and at Rivalieux-Quandamouzières
Sur Vantera-aux Alpes Maritimes. [<i>He stops exhausted.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Don’t stop. What’s wrong? [<span class="smcap">Almady</span> <i>takes
off his hat and gloves, puts the whip down on the
table, and, stepping out of character comes down
to</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> It’s these damned <i>French names</i>, they’re
perfectly frightful.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I don’t see what we can do about it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> You surely don’t need them all?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> They’re in the script.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> But I’ll go mad trying to memorize them.
Titles with six hyphens in them and names of
places with a dozen ‘aux’ and ‘de la’s’ and ‘sur’s.’
And, damn it, they’re all in <i>my</i> part. [<i>Choking
with fury.</i>] It’s deadly. At least, let’s leave out
that second castle.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Coldly.</i>] My dear fellow, have you no sense
of dramatic construction? If he had given her
only one castle, the audience would think her perfectly
justified in deceiving him. If he had given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
her three, they would look on him as a purse-proud
fool who didn’t deserve a faithful wife. No,
two is exactly the right number. You can’t beat
Sardou when it comes to technique. Go on please.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Almady</span> <i>goes up hopelessly and replaces his

</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> I made you a countess and a wealthy

Gilette de la Tour d’Argent, lord of Perigord
des Champignons and Saint Sulpice de la Grand

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Down to</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>as before</i>.] I’m sorry. I

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, I’m always open to suggestions. What

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Foche or Briand—or something short like
that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Perhaps—Vichy! Get on,

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> So <i>he</i> seems to think.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> I will not endure these shameful accusations.
You are insulting the woman who bears your
name.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Again taking off hat and gloves and puts
down the whip.</i>] It’s a damned shame.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What is?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> I always have to say the whole infernal
thing from beginning to end, and she just says
“your name.”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Coldly.</i>] We’re wasting time.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Another word, madame, and I produce the
proof.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] The proof? One is amused. One
smiles.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Takes stage and turns.</i>] A smile which I
will make to die upon your lips. Behold! The
proof! [<i>He fuddles in his coat-tail pocket from

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>With insincere terror.</i>] Ah, gracious heaven!
The peach! [<i>Sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Lays peach on table.</i>] Yes, madame, the
peach. The first peach that ripened on the lovingly
cherished, early-blooming, richly bearing,
East Indian dwarf peach trees in my orchard at
Simarineux de la Pomme d’Api, making a triumphant
entry into the world days ahead of any
other peach in the whole of France. [<i>He turns and
glares at</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>resentfully</i>, <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>pays no attention</i>,

a passionate fruit-grower I am. You know that I
have tended this peach from its first budding—cared
for it—watched over it—wrapped it about
with my love—kept a diary about it—and awaited
its ripening like the coming of a Messiah. And
what happens? This afternoon I go out riding.
I am proceeding at a gentle jog-trot—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Coldly.</i>] Along the high road—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Along the high road. And whom should I

maid. I speak to her. She betrays embarrassment
at seeing me. She stammers and ties her apron-strings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
in a knot. I ask her where she is going.
Terrified, she bursts into tears and whispers, ‘My
lady sent me to the Marquis Jean François Gilette
de la Tour d’Argent’—curse him!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Right. This time that <i>was</i> in the script.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Why, I ask the girl, did your mistress send
you to the Marquis? And then suddenly, happening
to look closer, I see that she is trying desperately
to hide a little parcel from me. I take it from
her, I open it, and what do I see? [<i>Points to
peach.</i>] That peach! The King of Peaches, the
apple of my eye—my pride and joy, my firstborn,
the supreme peach from the orchards of
Simarineux de la Pomme d’Api—the last word in
stoneless fruit which I have been guarding since
birth like a baby sister— And, as if this were not
enough, wrapped round that glorious specimen of
its kind, I discover a letter. [<i>He fuddles in his

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Again takes off his hat and gloves.</i> <i>To</i>

like ‘oh!’ ‘no!’ and ‘yes!’</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes—I noticed that myself. These short crisp

everything—love, name, rank, riches, estates—<i>two</i>
castles—and then you go about the place
sending my most cherished fruit to your lover!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Rises, tragically.</i>] No.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> You have the effrontery to pretend that the

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>With a theatrical laugh.</i>] A likely story.
Madame, I am a fruit-grower, the leading amateur
horticulturist in France and President of the
Paris Peach Club. I know—I say, I <i>know</i>—that
one does not give fruit like this save where one
has first given—the heart. Madame, I despise you.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> You consider conduct like mine despicable?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Good! Then I have one little question to ask
you. In the early Spring of this year there ripened
in your orchard the first crop of white-heart
cherries. To whom did you send those cherries?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Turns away embarrassed.</i>] To my mother.
The Dowager Countess du Veyrier de la Grande
Contumace Saint Emilion.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Indeed? To your mother? Then permit me
to show you something. You are not the only one
who has discovered an interesting letter. [<i>Takes
letter from table.</i>] Smell that! Do you recognize
the perfume? [<i>Holds it under his nose.</i>]</p>

whom you honor with your friendship and protection.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> How—how did you get this?</p>

sobs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> You see, what you do to me, I do to you. An
eye for an eye, a <i>tooth for a tooth</i>, a peach for a
cherry.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Brokenly.</i>] Yes. It’s true.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> And now, leave my garden. This very afternoon
I pack my boxes and go back to my mother.
And if you will question my maid you will find
that I told her to hang about till you came by—to
blush and stammer—and finally to give you the
letter <i>and</i> the peach. [<i>She breaks into stage
laughter.</i>] Ha, ha, ha! Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Well, I must face it. I’ve lost.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> You’ve lost <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Kneeling.</i>] Yvonne! Don’t say that. See!
I beg your forgiveness on my knees ... overlook
this one false step.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> The idea! A count, and an <i>elderly</i> count—grovelling
like that. [<span class="smcap">Almady</span> <i>gets up and turns
away</i>.] All the same, you have touched me. So I
will forgive you. But you are not to get off without
punishment. Firstly, I forbid you to eat this
peach.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> My God! Not that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Firmly.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> So be it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Secondly, you will permit me to go to Paris
alone—</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Despairingly.</i>] Yvonne!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Not a word. Either you trust me or you do
not! If you <i>do</i>, I will return. If <i>not</i>, <i>not</i>.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Oh, heavens! And how long do you expect
to stay in Paris?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> A week. [<i>Short pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Suddenly bursting out.</i>] No! I can’t live
without you. I worship you. I adore you. I love
you as the church steeple loves the cloud that settles
on its summit, only to be wafted away by the
first passing breeze. I can’t live without you. Not
a week, not a day. Not an hour.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Just words. [<i>At the word “church steeple”</i>
<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>have exchanged a glance of

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Rises.</i>] But ... but ... but.... Just

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Now, listen, <i>please</i>. We can’t have these interruptions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Don’t pull them up the moment they’ve

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> I can’t wait to see how it all ends. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.]
Will she leave him? Or will the memory of their

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>—<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] This is

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Quiet, quiet, please. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Almady</span>.] All right.
Go on. Better go back to “Not a week! Not a day!
Not an hour!”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> <i>Not a week! Not a day! Not an hour!</i></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Just words.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> It’s the truth. I’m crazy about you. And
you—you have used me up and squeezed me like
a lemon, and now you want to throw me away.
[<i>At the word “lemon”</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>again

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Sandor....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ilona</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Almady</span>.] You’ll excuse
me? I have something very urgent to say to Mr.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Feigning non-comprehension.</i>] How do you
mean, do I hear what they’re saying?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> I mean ... didn’t those last lines sound
familiar to you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That’s right. Now you mention it. I did notice
something, only I thought it was my fancy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] Come here. [<span class="smcap">Mell</span> <i>tries to
become a part of the whispered conference, but</i>
<span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>waves him away, and he withdraws upstage

Sandor—those lines were syllable for syllable the
ones we heard last night through the wall.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Looking at script.</i>] By Jove, you’re right....
This is uncanny.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Go on with the rehearsal, or they will be
suspecting something. I want to hear some more.
[<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>takes hold of</i> <span class="smcap">Adam’s</span> <i>arm</i>. <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>is very
excited. Both listen intently.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, let’s get on. “Now you want to throw me
away.”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> I don’t want to throw you away, silly, Oh,
come on, then. Come here and let me kiss that
beautiful classic brow. [<span class="smcap">Almady</span> <i>goes to her</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Shouting out.</i>] Great Heavens!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Jumping.</i>] What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Whispering.</i>] Listen, you two. They’re
saying word for word what we heard them say last
night. Do you grasp now what they were doing
last night? <i>Rehearsing!</i> Simply going through
their lines.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>.] I must admit ... this has
come upon me as a complete surprise.... Really,
I’m quite shaken.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Imitate <i>me</i>. If I can be perfectly calm, you
can.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>Pointing at</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span>.] And he never recognized
it!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Mr. Turai! What’s going on?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Yes. What’s all the discussion about?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Almady</span>.] Well, it’s like this. Mansky
says—and I’m bound to say I agree with him—that
for the actual performance to-night you will
have to dig up a classic brow from somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Dig up a classic brow?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> You see, it’s rather awkward. The script says
... “Kiss that beautiful classic brow.”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Well, you’ll have to get one somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] You think my own would not
be convincing?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> My God, no!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> It has been so described.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> In this play, yes. But, if you’ll pardon my
saying so, you wouldn’t suggest that any woman
of taste could say such a thing in <i>real</i> life?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] Very good. No doubt the property
man will be able to supply me with a face.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Sh! Sh! We’ve only a few minutes more.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> No more interruptions.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> Thank God!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Where were we? Oh, yes. Come here and let
me kiss that beautiful classic brow. [<i>Kisses him
on forehead.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> That’s not a kiss. That’s a tip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Surely that line is a trifle vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> It’s vulgar because it’s spoken by a vulgar
man.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> The speaker is a count.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> But a dull-witted bounder, for all that.
He’s the sort of man who <i>would</i> say things like
that. Don’t you start trying to teach Sardou how
to write dialogue.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Furious.</i>] For God’s sake, are we going
to rehearse?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Yes—go on, please.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> That’s not a kiss. That’s a tip.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Don’t shout like that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> I will shout. I’m a squeezed lemon. That’s
what I am—a lemon. The whole world shall know
I’m a lemon. [<i>Falls sobbing at her feet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Please—please— What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Nothing. I was merely saying to Adam

kill him. [<span class="smcap">Almady</span> <i>breaks off, evidently unwilling
to speak his next line. But</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>prompts
him relentlessly</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> A ridiculous old petticoat-chaser.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Speaking the lines almost sotto voce in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
a casual offhand manner.</i>] A ridiculous old petticoat-chaser,
that’s what I am. Bah!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Oh, come, Mr. Almady. Not so tamely, please.
More <i>life</i>. Once more.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Comes down to</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>and says the line
with petulance and irritation</i>.] A ridiculous old
petticoat-chaser, that’s what I am. Bah!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Relentlessly.</i>] Still not quite strong enough.
More gusto. More sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Shouts the line to relieve his fury.</i>] <span class="allsmcap">A RIDICULOUS
OLD PETTICOAT-CHASER, THAT’S WHAT
I AM. BAH!</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Coldly.</i>] Once more, please.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Shouting to the full limit of his vocal
chords in wild desperation.</i>] A RIDICULOUS
OLD PETTICOAT-CHASER, THAT’S WHAT
I AM. BAH!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>With approval.</i>] Fine—<i>that’s</i> it. Now read
it that way at the performance. [<span class="smcap">Almady</span> <i>returns
upstage completely crushed and beaten</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Genuinely.</i>] I promise you I shall never
again make myself obnoxious to this woman who
loves another man and is sick and tired of me.
Never, never again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Briskly.</i>] Never again?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Briskly.</i>] Never again.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Then, Maurice, I will be generous. I will not
go to Paris, and you may eat the peach.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Hurls himself at the peach.</i>] My God! At
last! [<i>Gnaws the peach.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>Rising.</i>] Curtain.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> The end?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> The end.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> He really should have given his wife the
peach. That would have made a much prettier
finish.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Oh, my dear fellow! Where’s your sense of
character? The man’s selfish to the core. He’d
never give his wife peaches.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> A very unsympathetic part. Still, he played
it well.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> It fitted him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> [<i>Dancing about in anguish, pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Almady</span>,
<i>incoherent with agitation</i>.] Oh! Oh!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> What’s the matter with you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MELL.</span> He’s eating the peach! He’s eating the peach!
I never dreamed he was going to <i>eat</i> the peach. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
shall have to dash out and get another. [<i>He
rushes off to the hall.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Takes off scarf. To</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, <i>who stands overcome
with happiness</i>.] Well, how do you like me in
this part?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Oh, darling, you were wonderful, simply wonderful.
And, if you want to know what I think—this
little comedy is worth all Shakespeare put
together. [<i>He kisses her hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Oh, no, no, no. The thing dates terribly.
When did Sardou write it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I don’t know. What period Sardou is this,
Mr. Almady?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> I should imagine it was his last work.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> Then he must have been a very old man at
the time. It’s terrible. He probably wrote it just
before he died.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Or just after. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ilona</span>.] Can I have a
minute? Just a few things I’d like to tell you
about your part.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> Yes, yes, I shall be very grateful. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] Go along. We shan’t be a moment.
[<i>They go up the stairs at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> What beats me is why an actor who has
always played heroes picked a part like that for
himself. He must be terribly fond of acting.
[<span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>go out at right</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Almady</span>, <i>who is sitting dejectedly at
left</i>.] You seem upset.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Miserably.</i>] Not at all. [<i>He glares at</i>
<span class="smcap">Turai</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> So you’ve decided to take the midnight express
directly after the performance?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> I think you’re wise. A good, fruity train,
highly spoken of by connoisseurs. Well, just to
show you the sort of fellows we Turais are, I’ll
let you off the major. Ilona, you can say lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> Even lieutenant seems a little....</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Good God! We can’t make him a drummer
boy.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> [<i>Picks up part.</i>] Very well. So be it. I suppose
I ought to be thankful for small mercies.
[<i>Goes toward door to hall.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Where are you off to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ALMADY.</span> I’m going to have another go at those infernal
French names. But in spite of everything—thank
you. [<span class="smcap">Almady</span> <i>bows and then goes out</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Going to</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>and embracing him</i>.] Sandor,
you’re an angel. Was it awfully difficult,
writing that play?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Oh, no. That damned peach stumped me for
a while. Smooth, round, velvety and fragrant, and
you mustn’t bite. It wasn’t easy to get round that.
Believe me, there are very few things in this world
that are round, smooth, velvety—and respectable.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> [<i>Turns head away.</i>] Oh—he was talking
about my shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> [<i>With delicate irony and gazing at her shoulder,
then kissing it.</i>] Really? I thought it was
your forehead.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ILONA.</span> You’re an old devil—that’s what you are.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Just what I expected. Now that it’s all over,
everybody else is a gentleman and I’m an old
devil. But somehow I don’t think I am. My little
Ilona, I have saved a young man a bad heartache.
It’s a negative kindness, but is there a positive
one that’s better? Yes, on the whole, I think
I’m fairly well satisfied with myself. And there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
a little old woman looking at me from somewhere—probably
from hell—and her eyes seem to be
twinkling, as if she was satisfied, too. It’s unfortunate,
that you won’t have me always on hand
to.... [<i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>On the landing, to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam</span>.] Poor old Turai’s
feeling awfully sore about all this. He had
a wonderful scheme for bringing you two together,
based on what he calls psychology. And now he’s
furious because that won’t be needed. [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Dwornitschek</span> <i>from hall</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ADAM.</span> Sh! Ilona will hear you. Let’s drop the subject.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> [<i>Standing at center.</i>] Dinner is
served. [<span class="smcap">Adam</span> <i>meets</i> <span class="smcap">Ilona</span> <i>at center. They embrace
and kiss lovingly and go out to the hall arm
in arm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">MANSKY.</span> [<i>With self-satisfaction to</i> <span class="smcap">Turai</span>.] So, my
friend, it comes down to this. There are many
clever writers, but the most successful of them all
is still old man life himself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> That’s because he doesn’t have to collaborate
with you. [<i>He takes</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky’s</span> <i>arm. As he passes</i>
<span class="smcap">Dwornitschek</span> <i>he stops and looks at him</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Dwornitschek, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> Still Dwornitschek—Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DWORNITSCHEK.</span> Thank <i>you</i>, sir.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">TURAI.</span> No, no, my dear Dwornitschek, thank YOU.
[<span class="smcap">Turai</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mansky</span> <i>go out</i>.]</p>
